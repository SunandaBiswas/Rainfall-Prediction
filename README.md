# Rainfall-Prediction-for-the-next-day

The goal of this project is to predict next day rain using different parameters of weather forecasting data. The dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations having 142193 entries with 23 different features from numerous Australian weather stations. Different machine learning models has been used such as  Multilayer perceptron Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Suport Vector Classifier for weather prediction.
